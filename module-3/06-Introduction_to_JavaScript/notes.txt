Read Evaluate Print Loop

Cant trust their answers - need to validate any information we get back from the client 

JavaScript variable set up sort of the same - no data types

no return type

${variable} ( used within a console.log

let keyword allows it to change
const variable doesnt change

variables can declared using var
or just assigning y = 7

dynamically add elements to a javascript array

const array means it always be an array, can remove and add things

all error in javascript are runtime 

@param Are expecting a certain data type

@param {Number} param1

function printParameters(param1, param2){

equality - shows what a variable is 
gives if they are equal 

double = does data conversion to a string and checks if the value is equal

triple =, checks the data type, does not do data conversion - use triple for all if you dont have a strong reason not to

what is truthy/falsy when would I use it?

console.table logs the objects

function objects() {
}
creates the object
$ - allows us to inject variables inside the string

stringy: function(){ < creates a name for a function
}

a function is always a method - 
concatnation is not preferred

function overloading is not available in javascript

typeof checks the data type
typeof num3 === 'number'

People can do whatever they want
Double quotes and single quotes are the same 
For string interpolation use ` like:  `$[this.lastName} is Bob`

only use colon for object creation

can dynamically add variables to objects at anytime

var declarations ignore scope blocks
let bound respects scopes

index: 25;
length:26;

string.lastIndexOf("red", (string.length - 4))
